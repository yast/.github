# The YaST Default Community Files

This repository contains the shared default community files like [CONTRIBUTING.md](
CONTRIBUTING.md) or [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for all YaST repositories.
If an YaST repository does not contain its own file these default files will
be used.

See more details in the [GitHub documentation](
