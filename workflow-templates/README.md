# GitHub Action Templates

This directory contains some templates for the [GitHub Actions](
https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions).

## Adapting the Templates

The templates needs to be adapted to project where they are deployed. The
templates contain several `FIXME` comments with description how to
adapt that part.

Of course, you can add more steps or remove some if they do not make sense
in your project. The files are really just templates...

## Adding a Workflow to Your Project

- You can add a workflow interactively in the GitHub Web UI, in the "Actions"
  tab in your project. See the GitHub [documentation](
  https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/sharing-workflows-with-your-organization#using-a-workflow-template).
- Or you can add a workflow manually, just copy the workflow template
  into the `.github/workflows` subdirectory.
